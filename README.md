Final project for Java Labolatories. Automatically generated crosswords.

## How it works?

I used dictionary with pairs of words and clues. In the app you can decide what size of cross word you want. You can alos choose difficulty.
Crosswords are generated with empty fields, but with only one click you can fill them in! All crosswords can be saved and loaded from file.

## How it looks?

## Built With
